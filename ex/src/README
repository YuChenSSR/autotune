ex1:
Standard surface code simulator.

ex2:
Standard topological cluster state simulator.

ex3:
First attempt at a low p asymptotic analyser, discrepancies with simulations observed at distances 6+.

ex4:
First attempt at database logical error rate upper bounder. No interpolation or extrapolation, rigid input format.

ex5:
Second attempt at database logical error rate upper bounder. More flexible input, interpolation and extrapolation, desire are better conversion algorithm from detailed error model to single variable balanced depolarizing.

ex6:
Direct multi-qubit measurement surface code simulator.

ex7:
Combination of ex3 and ex5.

ex7b:
Upgrade of the previous file to better integrate with the TORQUE tools.

ex8:
Slightly broken upgrade of the previous file bounding the physical error model error rates in a much better manner.

ex9:
Polybound example.
